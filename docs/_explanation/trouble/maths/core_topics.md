# Fundementals of Engineering Mathematics

## Essential Electronics and Electrical Engineering Topics

Linked below is the core text book (used in Level 4 modules). This covers the essential core of mathemematics, mathemematical techniques, and numeracy topics which ar eused in every engineering module.

The table below shows the core topics addressed in the _Handbook_ above in the context of other textbooks. These textbooks expand the topics in more detail: others offer an alternative introduction to the topics and theory covered in the _Handbook_. The _Further Reading_ section at the end of this page also gives a brief summary of these textbooks, which should help you to select particular sources for particular topics.

## Further Reading

* [Bird, J. (2021) _Higher Engineering Mathematics_. Nineth Edition. Milton: CRC Press LLC.](https://leedsbeckett.on.worldcat.org/oclc/1236267296). The recommended starting point for most, Bird covers the core topics assuming relatively little in the way of previous mathematical training. This textbook also focuses on the core engineering mathematics, and gives a useful application context to many of the tools and techniques covered.
* [Croft, T. (2017) _Engineering Mathematics: A Foundation for Electronic, Electrical, Communications and Systems Engineers_. Fifth Edition. Harlow, England: Pearson.](https://leedsbeckett.on.worldcat.org/oclc/975176473). The most focused on the mathematics covered by courses in electronics, electrical engineering and robotics. Crost is a useful general foundation, and a good reference for topics introduced at Level 5 and beyond.
* [Helping Engineers Learn Mathematics Workbooks (HELM)](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/mlsc/student-resources/helm-workbooks/).
* [Stroud, K.A. and Booth, D.J. (2020) _Engineering Mathematics_. Eighth Edition. London: Red Globe Press.](https://leedsbeckett.on.worldcat.org/oclc/1145419145). The recommended starting point for those with A-Level mathematics, or other significant mathematical experience at Level 3. Stroud introduces topics rapidly, and covers a lot of ground with a large selection of useful questions to explore topics in greater depth. An excellent source for many of the tools and techniques you will use both inside the course, and beyond it.
